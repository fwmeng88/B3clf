# B3clf

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) provides a well-designed system for protection and regulation of 
microvasculature in the central nervous system (CNS). Specifically, the BBB is responsible for 
the maintenance of homeostatis of the CNS and the protection of the CNS by inhibiting the 
transportation or passage of toxins, pathogens, and inflammations from the blood.
However, because of its resistance of exogenous compounds, the BBB also poses a challenge for the 
delivery of neuroactive molecules (i.e. drugs) into the CNS. It is estimated that 98\% of drugs 
and approximately 100\% of bio-molecular pharmaceuticals 
(such as peptides and monoclonal antibodies) suffer from BBB penetration problems.  
Understanding small molecules' BBB permeability is therefore not only vital for CNS drug discovery, 
but must be considered at an early stage in the drug-development pipeline to avoid costly failures 
drug formulation studies in late-stage.

The package `b3clf` predicts molecule BBB permeability by combine classification algorithms and 
resampling strategies. 

We need to install in order to compute PaDel descriptors,
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/fwmeng88/padelpy.git@master
```

todo:
- Add a complete README.md
- Add usage and a script to build the virtual environment
